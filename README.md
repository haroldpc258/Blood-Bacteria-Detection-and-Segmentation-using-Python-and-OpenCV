# **Blood Bacteria Detection and Segmentation using Python and OpenCV**
This repository contains a Python-based solution for detecting and segmenting bacteria in blood samples. The project involves loading a database of blood bacteria images, applying various filters and masks with different thresholds to perform segmentation, and utilizing the cv2.canny function for recognizing geometric shapes with multiple edges to outline the bacteria contours on the segmented images.

# Key Features and Components:

- Loading and preprocessing of blood bacteria image dataset.
- Application of filters and masks with adjustable thresholds for effective segmentation.
- Utilization of OpenCV's cv2.canny function for detecting geometric shapes representing bacteria contours.
- Python scripts demonstrating the entire process and showcasing the results.
